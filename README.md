## Pokemon Console Game in C#
This project is a console application implementing a Pokemon game in C# with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It was developed collaboratively in a team of two students.

### About the Project
#### Game Description
The Pokemon Console Game is a single-player text-based adventure where you can train different Pokemon by battling against other trainers, and ultimately against the gym leader to win the game. The project focuses on applying Object-Oriented Programming principles, with a focus on subtype polymorphism, to create a modular and extensible codebase.
