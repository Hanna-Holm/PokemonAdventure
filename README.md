## Pokemon Console Game in C#
This project is a console application implementing a Pokemon game in C# with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The game leverages subtype polymorphism through inheritance and interfaces, as well as method and constructor overloading. It was developed collaboratively by a team of two students.
